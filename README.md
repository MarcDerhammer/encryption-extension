1. Share your public key with anyone who will send you a message by using the Export button on the PUBLIC Key
1. Encrypt text using the `Encrypt` tab
![Encrypt](./demo-screens/Encrypt.png)
Select which recipients can read it from your list of public keys. It can be one or many.
1. Post the text somewhere where your recipient can see it (a website or something)
1. For most users it will look like this:
![Encrypted on website](./demo-screens/EncryptedWebContent.png)
1. However, for anyone with the private key, it will look like this (note the ðŸ”“ representing some content was decrypted)
![Decrypted on website](./demo-screens/DecryptedWebContent.png)
1. You can also use the `Decrypt` tab to decrypt messages manually with any of your private keys
